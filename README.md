## Why this matters

Building with technology in 2026 looks different than it did two years ago. AI assistants have moved from experimental to essential, and companies are looking for people who can work with them effectively.

This isn't about becoming a software engineer. It's about being able to build solutions with technology and data -- dashboards, automated workflows, prototypes -- regardless of your specific role.

| Traditional approach | AI-assisted approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Search Google, copy from Stack Overflow | Ask Claude Code to explain and implement |
| Hours debugging with print statements | AI analyzes errors and suggests fixes |
| Write boilerplate code manually | AI generates scaffolding; you focus on business logic |
| Learn frameworks by reading documentation | AI teaches you as you build |
| Work alone, limited by your own knowledge | AI as a second perspective when you get stuck |

## What you'll build

A Streamlit dashboard with KPI scorecards, a sales trend chart, and breakdowns by category and region. The dashboard itself is straightforward -- the point is the workflow you use to build it: writing a spec, tracking work in a `TASKS.md` file, building with an AI assistant, committing with Git, and deploying so anyone can access it.

## How it works

You'll set up the same tools that development teams use, then build a dashboard from a product requirements document using AI-assisted development.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| GitHub | Hosts your code and tracks versions |
| `TASKS.md` | An in-repo Markdown file that tracks tasks and requirements (current version; earlier versions used Jira) |
| Cursor | Code editor (VS Code-based, with AI features) |
| Claude Code | AI assistant that runs in your terminal |
| [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | A Claude Code plugin whose skills turn requirements into bite-sized plans |
| Python + Streamlit | What you build the dashboard with |

## Getting started

### Version 4 (current)

Two self-paced parts -- setup, then build & deploy -- using the Superpowers Claude Code plugin for skill-driven planning and an in-repo `TASKS.md` file for task tracking (no Jira account needed).

1. Start with [Part 1: Setup](v4/pre-work-setup.md) -- accounts, tools, repo setup (70-100 min, at your own pace)
2. Then [Part 2: Build & Deploy](v4/workshop-build-deploy.md) -- design, plan, track, build, and deploy the dashboard (~3 hours, self-paced)

### Version 3 (previous)

The same skill-driven build as Version 4, but tracking work in Jira via the Atlassian MCP server instead of a `TASKS.md` file.

1. Start with [Pre-work: Setup](v3/pre-work-setup.md) -- accounts, tools, repo setup (60-90 min on your own)
2. Then [Workshop: Build & Deploy](v3/workshop-build-deploy.md) -- design, plan, build, and deploy the dashboard (~3 hours, live)

### Version 2 (older)

Async pre-work + a 3-hour live workshop, using GitHub spec-kit for planning.

1. Start with [Pre-work: Setup](v2/pre-work-setup.md) -- accounts, tools, repo setup (60-90 min on your own)
2. Then [Workshop: Build & Deploy](v2/workshop-build-deploy.md) -- plan, build, and deploy the dashboard (~3 hours, live)

### Version 1 (original)

| -- | [Git Concepts](v1/03-git-concepts.md) | Reference if you're new to version control |
| 3 | [Session 2: Workflow](v1/04-session-2-workflow.md) | The full development workflow |

Reference materials: [Troubleshooting](v1/05-troubleshooting.md) · [Capstone Setup](v1/06-capstone-project-dev-environment.md) · [FAQ](v1/07-faq.md) · [Glossary](v1/08-glossary.md)

## Project materials

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [E-Commerce PRD](prd/ecommerce-analytics.md) | The product requirements document you'll build from |
| [Sales Data](data/sales-data.csv) | Sample dataset for the dashboard |

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge (pandas, simple scripts)
- A computer running macOS or Windows
- No prior experience with Git or AI coding tools

## Getting help

Try to solve it yourself first. Google the error message, or if you have Claude Code installed, ask it. If you're still stuck, post in the Teams General channel.
