## How to work through this guide

This guide is self-paced. Work through it top to bottom; each section builds on the one before it, so don't skip ahead. Most people finish in about three hours, but there's no clock: do it in one sitting or split it across a few sessions, whatever fits your schedule. (The per-section time labels add up to well under three hours because they only count the hands-on steps; the rest is reading, answering brainstorming's questions, and watching Claude build.) You'll save your progress with Git as you go (Section 4), so you can stop and pick up later without losing anything.

> **Didn't finish the setup yet?** Work through the [setup guide](pre-work-setup.md) first; most people finish it in under an hour. Then come back and complete the build here. Ask in the Teams General channel, or send me a direct message on Teams, if you get stuck.

---

## What you'll accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have taken a product requirements document through a full development workflow and produced a live analytics dashboard. Specifically, you'll have:

- Set up an in-repo `TASKS.md` board of milestones drawn from the PRD, with a shared Definition of Done
- Generated Superpowers artifacts: a design document and an implementation plan
- Moved each milestone from To Do to Done as you build
- Built a working Streamlit dashboard with AI-assisted coding
- Generated a `CLAUDE.md` with `/init` so the project carries its own context
- Committed and pushed code to GitHub with traceability from each milestone to its commits
- Deployed a live dashboard accessible by anyone with the URL

---

## Prerequisites check

Before starting, verify your Part 1 setup is complete. Open your cloned `ai-dev-workflow-tutorial` folder in Cursor first (File --> Open Folder); the terminal then opens at the project root, which is where these commands expect to run. Run each command in Cursor's terminal:

```bash
git --version
# Expected: git version 2.x.x

python3 --version       # macOS
python --version         # Windows
# Expected: Python 3.11.x or higher

ls data/sales-data.csv
# Windows cmd: dir data\sales-data.csv
# Expected: data/sales-data.csv (no error)

claude --version
# Expected: version number displayed
```

If any command fails, return to the [setup guide](pre-work-setup.md) and resolve the issue before proceeding. Make sure everything's working before you continue.

> **Heads up:** Websites and software update their interfaces regularly. A button label, sign-up flow, or menu option described here may look slightly different by the time you go through it. That's normal. Focus on the goal of each step rather than the exact clicks: once you know what a step is trying to accomplish, you can usually find the equivalent option even when the UI has moved. Read the screen, work it out, and keep going. Figuring things out on your own like this is itself a professional skill.

---

## The professional workflow

This is the workflow used at technology companies worldwide. You'll experience the entire cycle, from specification to deployment. This tutorial calls the approach *skill-driven development*. A *skill* here is a small, reusable piece of expertise Claude pulls in when it fits the task; instead of jumping straight to code, you let a chain of these skills run the work in order (brainstorm the design, plan the steps, then build), so the project has a clear shape before Claude writes anything.

```
┌─────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌────────┐
│   PRD   │ -> │   TASKS.md   │ -> │ brainstorming│ -> │writing-plans │ -> │  Code  │

└─────────┘    └───────────┘    └─────────┘    └───────────────────────────────┘
```

Each box in this diagram is a distinct stage you'll complete. The left-to-right flow on the top row moves from planning to execution. The right-to-left flow on the bottom row moves from saving your work to making it publicly available. Together, they form a closed loop: requirements become running software that stakeholders can access.

> **Why skill-driven development?** You could ask Claude "build me a dashboard" directly. But without a clear plan, Claude makes assumptions, and AI can build the wrong thing very fast. Superpowers' skills give the work structure: brainstorming explores what to build, writing-plans turns the design into a bite-sized plan, and executing-plans implements one task at a time. Letting the skills run their process is what makes AI-assisted coding predictable instead of chaotic. The same habit will help keep a bigger capstone project from drifting.

## Section 1: Set up your task board from the PRD (~15 min)

### Tracking work in a file

Professional teams track every piece of work so they always know what's done, what's in progress, and what's next. Many use a web app like Jira for this. In this tutorial, you'll track work in a single Markdown file that lives in your repository: `TASKS.md`.

Here is the difference:

```
Web-app tracker (e.g. Jira)          File-based tracker (TASKS.md)
┌──────────────┐                     ┌──────────────┐
│  Claude Code │                     │  Claude Code │
│  (terminal)  │                     │  (terminal)  │
└──────┬───────┘                     └──────┬───────┘
       │ needs a connector                 │ just opens a file
       │ + account + login                 │
       v                                    v
┌──────────────┐                     ┌──────────────┐
│  Jira (cloud)│                     │  TASKS.md     │
│  separate    │                     │  in your repo │
│  website     │                     │  next to code │
└──────────────┘                     └──────────────┘
```

> **Why track work in a file?** A Markdown file has real advantages for a project like this one:
> - **No extra account or connection.** Claude Code can already read and write files in your project, so it updates your task board directly, with no web app to switch to and no login to keep alive.
> - **Versioned with your code.** `TASKS.md` is committed to Git alongside `app.py`. At any point in history, the task board and the code are in sync. Run `git log -- TASKS.md` and you can see exactly how the work evolved: the same audit trail a tracker like Jira gives you, built into your repo.
> - **Diffable and reviewable.** Changes to tasks show up in your commits and diffs like any other file.
> - **It works offline and travels with the project.** The same file works in Claude Code, Cursor, or any editor.
>
> This is a real, current industry pattern, not a training-wheels version. Teams building with AI coding agents increasingly keep their task lists in the repo so the agent can read and update them directly. (The open-source tool [Backlog.md](https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md) formalizes the same idea at larger scale.)

### Two kinds of "to-do list" (don't mix them up)

As you work, Claude Code shows its own live checklist while it's thinking; you'll see items get checked off in real time. That's an in-session scratchpad (Claude Code calls it the todo list). **It disappears when the session ends or you run `/clear`.**

`TASKS.md` is different. It's the **durable** record you commit to Git. It survives new sessions, grading, and your own memory a month from now. When this guide says "update your task board," it always means the file, not Claude's temporary checklist.

### Steps

1. **Start Claude Code** from your project directory in Cursor's terminal. To open one, go to **Terminal** --> **New Terminal** in the menu bar (or press `` Ctrl+` ``). Then run:

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

   Superpowers loads automatically for the session (you installed and verified it in Part 1). If you're not sure it's active, ask Claude `Is the Superpowers plugin installed?`

2. **Set the output style to Explanatory.** Inside Claude Code, open the settings menu:

   ```
   /config
   ```

   Navigate with the **arrow keys**: highlight **Output style** and press **Enter**, then highlight **Explanatory**, press **Enter** to confirm, and press **Esc** to close the config menu. (Depending on your terminal, you may also be able to click an option with your mouse, but the arrow keys always work.) By default, Claude Code keeps its responses short; the Explanatory style tells Claude to explain what it's doing and why as it works, which helps you learn from it instead of just receiving code. The choice saves to your project's `.claude/settings.local.json` and persists across sessions, so you only set it once.

   > **Prefer editing the file?** You can set the same thing directly by adding `"outputStyle": "Explanatory"` to `.claude/settings.local.json`.

3. **Read the PRD first.** Your task board should reflect what the project needs to deliver, and that's spelled out in the product requirements document.

   > **What is a PRD?** A PRD (Product Requirements Document) is a written description of what you're building and why. It defines the problem, the users, the features, and what success looks like. It doesn't come out of thin air: someone (usually a product manager or business analyst) interviews the stakeholders, the people who will use the product or are paying for it, to learn what they actually need, then writes those needs down as requirements. In professional settings, the PRD is agreed on before any code is written. (For this tutorial, we've written the PRD for you so you can focus on the build; in your capstone, you'll gather requirements from your own stakeholders.)

   Open the [PRD](prd/ecommerce-analytics.md) and skim it (in your browser, or open `prd/ecommerce-analytics.md` in Cursor). Look at two sections in particular: **Acceptance Criteria** and **Timeline and Milestones**. The PRD already sketches the deliverables your board will track; you're not inventing them from scratch.

4. **Create your task board from the PRD.** Ask Claude Code to draft it:

   ```
   Read @prd/ecommerce-analytics.md. Create a TASKS.md file in the project root with:
   - a short note at the top saying this file tracks all work for the dashboard
   - a "Definition of Done" checklist that applies to every milestone: acceptance criteria met; app runs locally with `streamlit run app.py`; changes committed with the milestone ID in the message
   - a "To Do" section with 4-8 milestones based on the PRD's deliverables and its Milestones table, numbered TASK-1, TASK-2, and so on, each with a one-line description and 1-3 acceptance criteria as checkboxes
   - empty "In Progress" and "Done" sections
   ```

   > **The `@` symbol: pointing Claude at a file.** This is the first time you use it. `@prd/ecommerce-analytics.md` tells Claude Code to pull that exact file into the conversation, so it works from the real contents instead of guessing or making you copy and paste them. You can point at a whole folder the same way (like `@docs/superpowers/plans/`). When you type `@`, Claude Code shows a list of files and folders and autocompletes the path as you go, so you rarely type the whole thing. Pointing the AI at the right file is a small habit with a big payoff. You get better output, because the more precisely you set the context, the more on-target the result. And you get faster, cheaper output: because Claude reads just the file you named, it doesn't burn time and tokens (the chunks of text a model processes) searching your project for the right context, which means quicker replies and more headroom before you hit your plan's usage limits. You'll use `@` throughout the rest of this guide.

   Claude reads the PRD and drafts the board. Open `TASKS.md` in Cursor and read it. It should look roughly like this:

   ```markdown
   # Sales Dashboard: Tasks

   This file tracks all work for the e-commerce sales dashboard.
   Each milestone moves through To Do -> In Progress -> Done.

   ## Definition of Done (applies to every milestone)
   - [ ] Acceptance criteria met
   - [ ] App runs locally with `streamlit run app.py`
   - [ ] Changes committed with the milestone ID in the message

   ## To Do
   - [ ] **TASK-1: Project setup and data loading**
     - [ ] App runs with `streamlit run app.py` and shows a title
     - [ ] Loads `data/sales-data.csv`; handles a missing file cleanly
   - [ ] **TASK-2: KPI scorecards**
     - [ ] Total Sales and Total Orders shown as formatted metrics
   - [ ] **TASK-3: Sales trend chart**
     - [ ] Line chart of sales over time renders from the data
   - [ ] **TASK-4: Category and region breakdowns**
     - [ ] Bar charts for sales by category and by region, sorted by value
   - [ ] **TASK-5: Test and deploy**
     - [ ] Dashboard runs without errors and is deployed to a public URL

   ## In Progress

   ## Done
   ```

   Your milestones may differ a little, and that's fine. Read them against the PRD and adjust anything that doesn't match what you want to build. You're aiming for a short list you could read aloud in a status update: the *what*, not the *how*. (Superpowers works out the *how* in the next section.)

   > **What is a Definition of Done?** It's a quality checklist that applies to *every* milestone, no matter what it is. Each milestone also gets its own **acceptance criteria** (the specific thing that milestone must do). The Definition of Done is the shared bar underneath all of them: "before I call anything done, these things are always true." Professional teams agree on a Definition of Done so "done" means the same thing to everyone.

**Checkpoint:** `TASKS.md` exists in your project root with a Definition of Done and 4-8 milestones (TASK-1, TASK-2, ...) in the To Do section, drafted from the PRD.

## Section 2: Brainstorm and plan (~30 min)

### Understanding skill-driven development

The rest of the tutorial flows from what you create here. Every step that follows (coding, committing, deploying) depends on the design and plan you produce in this section.

> **The problem with "just code it":** When you ask an AI to build something without a clear design, you get something that might work but probably isn't what you wanted. The AI fills in gaps with assumptions, and each assumption is a potential mismatch with your intent. With a deliverable like an analytics dashboard, even small mismatches compound: the wrong chart type, unexpected aggregation, a layout that doesn't serve the audience.

Superpowers solves this by chaining three skills:

```
brainstorming -> writing-plans -> executing-plans
(design doc)    (impl plan)      (code, tested, committed)
```

Each skill narrows the space of possible outcomes. By the time executing-plans runs, Claude knows what to build, how to build it, and in what order. The result is more likely to match what you actually wanted.

### 2.1 Create the feature branch

Before you build anything, you'll set up a separate branch to work on. If you're new to Git, here's what that means and why it matters.

> **What is a branch, and why make one?** A **branch** is a separate line of work in your project, like a parallel copy you can change freely without touching the original. Your project already has one branch, called `main`: the official, working version of the code. Instead of building directly on `main`, you'll make a new branch just for this dashboard (a **feature branch**) and do all your work there. That keeps `main` clean and stable, so if something breaks while you build, the trusted version stays safe. When the feature is finished and tested, you merge your branch back into `main` (Section 4.5). This is how professional teams work: build on a branch, then merge.

You could type the Git command yourself, but you don't have to. In Claude Code, just ask:

```
Create a new git branch called feature/sales-dashboard and switch to it.
```

Claude runs the command and confirms you're on the new branch.

The name `feature/sales-dashboard` follows a common convention: a `feature/` prefix plus a short, hyphenated description of what you're building. You'll name your own branches this way in the capstone, so a branch says at a glance what work it holds.

> **This is the whole idea.** You don't memorize Git commands in this tutorial. When you need one, describe what you want and let Claude Code run it. It'll show you the command it used (here, `git checkout -b feature/sales-dashboard`), so you pick up the vocabulary as you go instead of drilling it up front.

**Checkpoint:** Ask Claude "which branch am I on?" It should be `feature/sales-dashboard`.

Now that you're on your feature branch, save the task board you created in Section 1 so it's under version control. In Claude Code:

```
Commit TASKS.md with the message "Add task board from the PRD".
```

From here on, your board lives in Git. It's saved locally for now; you'll push it to GitHub in Section 4, along with your first milestone (that's when the guide covers pushing). As you finish each milestone, you'll commit an update to the board.

> **Optional Pro Tip: keep your bearings on screen.** Instead of asking which branch you're on each time, you can pin a status line to the bottom of Claude Code that shows it all the time. Ask it once:
>
> ```
> /statusline show the current git branch, the folder, the model, the reasoning effort, and the context usage
> ```
>
> Claude writes the setup for you (no scripting needed), and it appears in every session from then on, including your capstone. This is a nice-to-have, not part of the build, so if it doesn't render cleanly on your machine, just skip it.

### 2.2 Brainstorm and plan with one prompt

This is the moment the workflow shifts from "you driving Claude" to "Claude running a process you observe." You already know the *what*: the milestones on your board. Now you give Claude one prompt; the brainstorming skill activates, asks you questions, writes a design doc, and hands off to writing-plans, which produces an implementation plan for the *how*. You'll see each skill load in the output as it activates.

1. **Send the prompt.** In your Claude Code session (still open from Section 1), send the prompt below. It points at the PRD and your milestones, and sets a few ground rules so the plan fits this project:

   ```
   Help me design and plan the e-commerce sales dashboard described in
   @prd/ecommerce-analytics.md. I'm tracking the milestones in @TASKS.md.
   Structure the plan so its steps cover each one. Make deployment the
   final step of the plan, marked as mine to execute: I'll deploy it
   myself from the main branch after we merge, so the plan should stop
   there and hand off to me. Ground rules: work on my current feature
   branch (do not create a git worktree), set up a Python virtual
   environment in venv/ for dependencies, and keep the code simple and
   readable so I can follow it.
   ```

   > **What those ground rules mean.** You're setting these constraints on purpose, not parroting them:
   > - **deployment is planned, but marked as yours.** Real plans include deployment; what a professional team controls is who executes it. Publishing needs your accounts (GitHub, Streamlit) and a go/no-go call, so the plan carries the step but stops and hands it to you: you'll run it yourself in Section 5, from `main`, after the merge. This is a prompt pattern worth reusing on any AI-planned project: mark the steps that publish work or need your credentials as human-executed.
   > - **do not create a git worktree.** A *worktree* is a separate working copy of your project. Superpowers would normally make one, but you keep things simple by staying on the single feature branch you created (more in the skills table at the end).
   > - **set up a Python virtual environment in `venv/`.** This is a private space for this project's Python packages, so they don't clash with anything else on your machine. Claude sets it up while building, and it's explained where you use it in Section 4.1.
   > - **keep the code simple and readable,** so you can follow what gets built, which is the whole point.
   >
   > Giving the AI clear constraints like these is itself a skill: you get a plan shaped to *your* project instead of its defaults.

2. **Answer brainstorming's questions.** Claude loads the brainstorming skill (you'll see a `Skill(superpowers:brainstorming)` line with `Successfully loaded skill` under it), then asks you 3-5 clarifying questions, one at a time, on things like which KPIs matter most, how interactive the charts should be, and what edge cases to handle. Pick the options that fit your vision, or type your own preference.

3. **Review the design doc (your chance to change it).** Brainstorming writes a design doc to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-sales-dashboard-design.md`, then pauses and asks you to review it before turning it into a plan (something like *"give the spec a read and let me know if you want any changes; if it looks right, say the word and I'll draft the plan"*). This is the most important checkpoint in the process: the design is about to drive the plan and then the code, so now is the moment to catch anything wrong or missing, while it's cheap to fix. Open the file in Cursor and read it: in the file explorer on the left, expand the `docs` folder, then `superpowers`, then `specs`, and click the design doc to open it. (No sidebar? Press `Cmd+B` on macOS or `Ctrl+B` on Windows to toggle it.) It opens as raw Markdown, so to read it as a formatted document, press `Cmd+Shift+V` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows), or click the **Open Preview** button in the editor's top-right toolbar. If anything is off (a wrong chart type, a missing KPI, an assumption you disagree with), just tell Claude what to change and it will revise the spec. Keep going until the spec captures what you want.

4. **Approve the spec, then review the plan.** When the spec captures what you want, tell Claude to proceed. In Claude Code:

   ```
   The spec looks good. Go ahead and write the implementation plan.
   ```

   Claude hands off to writing-plans (you'll see a `Skill(superpowers:writing-plans)` line with `Successfully loaded skill` under it, just like the brainstorming skill earlier), which produces an implementation plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-sales-dashboard.md`. Open it the same way (expand `docs`, then `superpowers`, then `plans`, then preview it) and read it. The plan contains bite-sized tasks; some are flagged for test-driven development (TDD), typically data transformations like KPI calculations and date filtering. Also check the plan's last step: it should be deployment, marked as yours to execute from `main` after the merge, exactly as you asked in the prompt. The design doc captures *what* to build; the plan captures *how* to build it, task by task.

5. **Choose how Claude will execute the plan.** After the plan is written, Claude asks one last question before any code runs: how do you want it to execute the plan? You'll usually see two options:

   - **Subagent-driven**: Claude hands each task to a fresh helper agent (a *subagent*) that works on it separately, with a review between tasks. Picture delegating each task to a new contractor who starts with a clean slate: nothing from earlier tasks clutters their head, so mistakes get caught early. The tradeoff is that the work happens offstage. You see the results, not the process.
   - **Inline execution**: Claude does every task itself, right in your session, pausing at checkpoints so you can review. Each test, file, and decision scrolls past on your screen as it happens.

   For this tutorial you want **inline execution**: watching the process is the point, and it keeps everything in one conversation. Answer now, but tell Claude to wait before building, since you have a bit of reading to do first:

   ```
   Use inline execution, but wait for my go-ahead before starting the first
   task.
   ```

   You'll give that go-ahead in Section 4.1, after a short look at how the plan relates to your task board.

> **Why write this down before any code runs?** The hard part of any project is the thinking: framing the problem, choosing an approach, weighing tradeoffs. That's exactly the part it's tempting to hand to the AI, and exactly the part you learn the most from keeping. Writing the spec and plan first forces your reasoning onto the record, where you and a reviewer can see it, instead of letting it disappear into the tool. The two files you just read are that record.

> **Why TDD on some tasks?** Some plan tasks are flagged for **test-driven development (TDD)**: Claude writes a small test before the code, so the behavior is pinned down before anything is built. It's used where it pays off, on data transformations like KPI calculations and date filtering, and skipped for chart rendering, where Streamlit components are hard to test meaningfully. You'll watch a TDD task play out step by step when you build in Section 4.

> **Skill handoff cheat sheet (the chain you just experienced):**
>
> ```
> [you type one prompt]
>      |
>      v
> using-superpowers (auto)
>      |

>      |
>      v  (skipped worktree per your prompt)

> ```
>
> In Section 4 the chain continues: `executing-plans` builds task by task, then `requesting-code-review` and `finishing-a-development-branch` wrap up. Each skill shows up as a `Skill(superpowers:<name>)` line, so if you lose track, scroll up to the most recent one.

**Checkpoint:** You have two new files: a design doc in `docs/superpowers/specs/` and an implementation plan in `docs/superpowers/plans/`. Both are committed to your feature branch (Superpowers commits the design doc automatically; the plan commit may be combined with the first implementation task).

---

## Section 3: Two artifacts, two altitudes (~5 min)

You now have two planning documents. Being clear on how they relate matters; this is where students most often get confused.

- **`TASKS.md`** holds your **milestones**: the coarse deliverables you drafted from the PRD in Section 1. This is the *what*, and the board you track status on.
- **The implementation plan** (`docs/superpowers/plans/...`) holds the **detailed steps** Superpowers just produced. This is the *how*, and the checklist Claude builds from.

> **The two artifacts, and why they don't overlap:**
>
> | | `TASKS.md` | Implementation plan |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Lives in** | project root | `docs/superpowers/plans/` |
> | **Granularity** | Coarse (~4-8 milestones) | Fine (every engineering step) |
> | **Comes from** | the PRD, up front (Section 1) | brainstorming + the design doc (Section 2) |
> | **Updated by** | you, with Claude's help | Superpowers (`executing-plans` checks steps off as it builds) |
> | **Answers** | "What's the status of the dashboard?" | "What's the next step to code?" |
> | **Audience** | you, your grader, a stakeholder | Claude (the builder) |
>
> `TASKS.md` is the "what and where-are-we." The plan is the "how." One milestone on your board covers several steps in the plan; they're two zoom levels of the same work, not two copies of it. You track from the board; Claude builds from the plan.

  You set these (from the PRD)            Superpowers wrote these (the how)
```

**Checkpoint:** You can pick any step in the implementation plan and say which milestone on your board it belongs to.

> **Pro Tip:** Notice the zoom levels. The PRD said "display Total Sales." The plan breaks that into steps ("compute total sales with a test," "render a metric component"). Your board zooms back out to one milestone: "KPI scorecards." Same work, three altitudes: requirement, engineering steps, trackable deliverable. Being able to move between them is a real skill.

## Section 4: Build the dashboard (~35 min)

### Understanding Streamlit

> **What is Streamlit?** Streamlit is a Python library that transforms Python scripts into interactive web applications. Instead of writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (the traditional technologies for building web pages), you write Python and Streamlit handles the web interface automatically. It's especially popular in data science and business analytics because it lets analysts create dashboards quickly using the language they already know.
>
> For example, this Python code:
> ```python
> import streamlit as st
> st.title("Sales Dashboard")
> st.metric("Total Sales", "$116,500")
> ```
> produces a web page with a title and a formatted metric card. No HTML needed.
>
> Streamlit isn't the only option for dashboards (Tableau, Power BI, and Dash are alternatives), but it works well for capstone projects: it uses pure Python, integrates with Pandas and Plotly, and deploys for free. You can use the same data manipulation skills you learned in your coursework.

### Claude Code editing modes

Before you start building, understand how Claude Code interacts with your files. Claude Code has three editing modes that control how it handles file changes:

| Mode | Behavior | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Normal** (default) | Asks permission before each edit | When learning and reviewing each change carefully |
| **Accept edits** | Makes edits without asking | When you trust the workflow and want momentum |
| **Plan mode** | Explains what it will do, waits for approval, then executes | When you want to review the approach before execution |

Press **Shift+Tab** to cycle between modes. The current mode (for example, "accept edits on" or "plan mode on") shows at the bottom of the Claude Code interface.

> **Recommendation:** Switch to **Accept edits** mode for the build phase. You've already defined detailed specifications, and Claude will follow them. Accept edits lets you maintain momentum through the implementation cycle. If you prefer to review each change (a valid learning choice), stay in Normal mode; it'll just take longer.

### 4.1 Implement the first milestone

Milestones are in plan order, so you'll work top-down: TASK-1 first. Within a milestone, Claude works through the plan steps it covers, one at a time.

1. Back in Section 2.2 you told Claude to wait for your go-ahead. This is it. Start the first milestone and move it to In Progress on your board:

   ```
   Let's work on TASK-1. Move it to the In Progress section of TASKS.md, then
   implement the plan steps it covers.
   ```

   Claude invokes `executing-plans` (you'll see `Skill(superpowers:executing-plans)` in the output). The skill reads the plan and works through the steps under this milestone, one at a time.

   > **What you'll see during a TDD step:** For plan steps flagged as test-driven (typically data-transformation steps like `compute_total_sales`), executing-plans will: (a) write a failing test in a `tests/` file, (b) run pytest (Python's test runner) and show you the failure, (c) implement the function, (d) run pytest again and show you the pass, (e) commit. For non-TDD steps (chart rendering, page layout), it'll skip straight to implementation and commit. A single milestone may contain several such steps. Watch the test output: seeing red turn green is one of the more satisfying parts of the build.

   > **What happens during implementation:** Claude reads the task and its acceptance criteria, consults the specification and plan, then writes the code. Watch the output; you'll see Claude creating files, writing functions, and making decisions. Pay attention to which libraries Claude imports, how it structures the code, and how it handles data loading.

   > **How Claude moves to the next task:** Inline execution pauses at a checkpoint after each plan step: Claude reports what it built (and whether tests passed), then asks if it should continue. Skim the report, and if it matches what you expected, tell it to keep going. Repeat until it finishes the steps under TASK-1. If it offers to roll straight into the next milestone's steps, hold it there; you drive milestone-by-milestone from your board, and you'll test the dashboard first (step 3 below).

2. In Claude Code, ask Claude to explain what it created:

   ```
   What files did you create? Explain what each one does.
   ```

   Understanding the file structure helps you learn from the AI's work rather than treating it as a black box.

3. Test the dashboard. Claude set up the `venv/` virtual environment while implementing TASK-1, so it's ready to use (if it isn't there for any reason, Claude will create it). In Claude Code:

   ```
   Activate my virtual environment and run the Streamlit app so I can test it.
   ```

   > **Key Concept: Virtual Environments.** A **virtual environment** (the `venv/` folder) is an isolated Python installation specific to this project. Without it, packages you install might conflict with other Python projects on your machine. It keeps your dashboard's dependencies (Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly) contained within this project. That's what "activate my virtual environment" asks for: use this project's Python, not the machine-wide one. If you ever run the app yourself in Cursor's terminal, activate it first with `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows), then `streamlit run app.py`; you'll see `(venv)` at the start of the prompt while it's active.

4. Claude starts the server and reports the **Local URL**, for example `http://localhost:8501` (the port number can differ if something else on your machine is already using that one). Open whatever URL it gives you: hold `Cmd` (macOS) or `Ctrl` (Windows) and click the link, or copy it into your browser. You should see the beginnings of your dashboard: likely a title and confirmation that the data loaded.

**Checkpoint:** The dashboard runs locally at the Local URL Claude reported, without errors.

### 4.2 Commit, push, and update TASKS.md

Now you'll save your work using Git and create a traceable link between your code and the task it fulfills. This three-step process (commit, push, update) is the basic rhythm of professional development.

#### Understanding Git's workflow

Git tracks your code changes through a series of stages. Understanding these stages prevents confusion about where your changes "live" at any point:

```
┌─────────────┐    git add    ┌─────────────┐   git commit   ┌─────────────┐
│  Your edits │ ───────────> │   Staging    │ ─────────────> │  Local repo │
│  (working   │              │    Area      │                │  (history)  │
│   directory) │              │              │                │             │
│             │              │  "Ready to   │                │  "Saved     │
│  Files you  │              │   be saved"  │                │   snapshot" │
│  changed    │              │              │                │             │
└─────────────┘              └─────────────┘                └─────────────┘
                                                                   │
                                                              git push
                                                                   │
                                                                   v
                                                            ┌─────────────┐
                                                            │   GitHub    │
                                                            │  (remote)   │
                                                            │             │
                                                            │  "Backed up │
                                                            │   & shared" │
                                                            └─────────────┘
```

Here is what each stage means:

- **Working directory:** the files on your computer as you edit them. Changes here aren't yet tracked by Git.
- **Staging area:** a holding zone for changes you intend to include in your next commit. The `git add` command moves changes here. This is like placing items in a box before sealing it.
- **Local repository:** your project's history of saved snapshots. The `git commit` command creates a new snapshot from everything in the staging area. Each snapshot is permanent and can be revisited.
- **Remote (GitHub):** the cloud copy of your repository. The `git push` command uploads your local commits to GitHub, making them visible to others and serving as a backup.

> **Key Concept: Traceability Through Commit Messages.**
> When you include the milestone ID (like TASK-1) in your commit message, you create a traceable link that connects your code change to the milestone that prompted it:
>
> ```
> TASK-1 in TASKS.md --> Commit "TASK-1: set up project and data loading" --> GitHub --> Deployed Dashboard
> ```
>
> A milestone may span more than one commit (executing-plans commits each plan step as it builds). What matters is that its commits carry the milestone ID and the board records where the work landed. Because `TASKS.md` is versioned too, `git log -- TASKS.md` then shows the full history of how milestones moved from To Do to Done. In professional environments, this traceability is how teams maintain accountability, conduct code reviews, and audit changes.

#### Steps

1. **Verify the milestone's commits.** As it worked through the milestone, executing-plans committed each plan step along the way, so there's usually nothing left to commit by the time you get here. This step is a check, not busywork: you're confirming the work is saved, the commits carry the milestone ID, and junk like `venv/` stayed out of the repo. In Claude Code:

   ```
   Is everything for TASK-1 committed, with the milestone ID in the commit
   messages? Commit anything still outstanding, and confirm venv/ is
   covered by .gitignore.
   ```

   Two outcomes, both fine: Claude reports it's all already committed (the usual case), or it commits the stragglers. Either way you end with a clean working tree and TASK-1's history in Git.

   > **Key Concept: .gitignore.** The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files and directories to ignore. Virtual environments (`venv/`), compiled files, and operating system files should never be committed to a repository; they're large, machine-specific, and can be regenerated. The `.gitignore` file prevents accidental commits of these files.

   > **What is a commit hash?** Each commit gets a unique identifier called a **commit hash**, a string like `05a9ada`. It's a fingerprint: no two commits in your repository will ever share one. A milestone may produce several commits; you'll record the last one (or the range) next to the milestone in `TASKS.md` so anyone can find the code that fulfilled it.

2. **Push to GitHub.** In Claude Code, upload your local commit to the remote repository:

   ```
   Push my changes to GitHub.
   ```

   If this is your first push on the feature branch, Claude may need to set the upstream tracking branch. It handles this automatically.

3. **Update your task board, then save it.** In Claude Code, close the loop by recording what you did and committing that update so it lands on GitHub with this milestone. Claude sometimes moves the milestone to Done on its own while committing; this step makes sure the rest of the record (checked criteria, commit hash) is there too:

   ```
   Update TASK-1 in TASKS.md: check off its acceptance criteria and the
   Definition of Done, record the commit hash, and move it to Done if it
   isn't already. Then commit TASKS.md with a message like "TASK-1: mark
   done on the board" and push.
   ```

   Claude edits `TASKS.md`, commits that change, and pushes it, so your board on GitHub shows TASK-1 done right away instead of trailing into the next milestone's commit.

4. **Verify on your board.** Open `TASKS.md` in Cursor and confirm:
   - TASK-1 is now in the Done section
   - Its acceptance criteria and the Definition of Done are checked off
   - The commit hash is recorded next to it

**Checkpoint:** Code and the updated board are on GitHub. TASK-1 shows in the Done section of `TASKS.md` with its criteria checked and commit recorded.

### 4.3 Complete remaining milestones

Now repeat the cycle for each remaining milestone on your board, in order. If one of your milestones is deployment, skip it for now; that comes in Section 5.

The cycle for each milestone is:

```
Take the next milestone
        |
        v
"Let's work on TASK-N" --> Move to In Progress --> executing-plans works its plan steps
        |
        v
Test the dashboard (ask Claude to run it)
        |
        v
Make sure the milestone's commits carry the milestone ID
        |
        v
Push to GitHub
        |
        v
Update TASKS.md --> check off, move to Done --> commit + push the board
```

Here is the pattern for each milestone. In Claude Code:

```
Let's work on TASK-2. Move it to In Progress in TASKS.md, then implement the plan steps it covers.
```

Claude auto-invokes `executing-plans` and works through the plan steps under the milestone.

After implementation and testing, in Claude Code:

```
Verify everything for TASK-2 is committed with the milestone ID, commit
anything still outstanding, and push to GitHub.

Then update TASK-2 in TASKS.md: check off its acceptance criteria and the
Definition of Done, record the commit hash, and move it to Done if it
isn't already. Commit that board update and push it too.
```

> **Now loop until the board is done.** The prompts above show TASK-2, but this cycle is the rest of your build: run it again for TASK-3, then TASK-4, and every remaining implementation milestone, swapping in the current milestone ID each time. You're finished with this section only when every implementation milestone sits in the Done section of `TASKS.md`. One prompt pair per milestone; don't stop after TASK-2.

> **Handy: accept Claude's next-prompt suggestions.** As you repeat this cycle, Claude Code often shows a dimmed suggestion in the input box, its guess at what you might type next (like committing, or starting the next milestone). Press the **right arrow** (or **Tab**) to drop it into your prompt, then **Enter** to send it. To write your own instead, just start typing and the suggestion disappears. It's on by default; you can turn it off in `/config` if you find it distracting.

> **Leave the deployment milestone in To Do (if you have one).** The plan's deployment step is gated on you: you marked it as yours in the Section 2.2 prompt, so this build loop covers the implementation milestones only. Claude may still offer to start deployment for you; if it does, or if it has already moved the milestone to In Progress, hold the gate:
>
> ```
> Deployment is my step. Move that milestone back to To Do; I'll run it
> from main after we merge.
> ```
>
> This is the ground rule from Section 2.2 in action: the AI builds, but you decide when your work goes live.

> **Pro Tip:** Watch Claude's output as it works each milestone. You'll see files being created, imports being added, and functions being written. This is a good way to learn how professional code is structured. Pay attention to how Claude names variables, organizes functions, and handles data. You can reuse these patterns in your capstone.

After working through all implementation milestones, test the complete dashboard one final time. In Claude Code:

```
Activate my virtual environment and run the Streamlit app so I can test
the complete dashboard.
```

Open whatever Local URL Claude reports (for example `http://localhost:8501`) and verify that all components are present: KPI scorecards, a sales trend line chart, and category/region bar charts.

**Checkpoint:** All implementation milestones are in the Done section of `TASKS.md` with their criteria checked and commits recorded. Only a deployment milestone (if you have one) remains in To Do.

### 4.4 Capture project memory with /init

Your dashboard is built and working, so now is the moment to give your project a memory. You'll generate a `CLAUDE.md`, a file Claude Code reads at the start of every session, so future sessions (and your capstone) begin with context instead of a blank slate.

> **If Claude offered to merge to main after your last milestone:** hold off. After the final plan step, Superpowers may review the diff and offer to merge (the `finishing-a-development-branch` step). Let it review, but do this `/init` step first so `CLAUDE.md` is part of the merge; then merge in Section 4.5.

> **What is CLAUDE.md, and why now?** `CLAUDE.md` documents your project for the AI: how to run it, where the key files live, the conventions you follow. Claude Code's `/init` command writes one for you by scanning your code. That's why you do it *now* and not at the start: at the start there's nothing to describe; now it can capture your actual project. It also pays off on a team: because `CLAUDE.md` is committed to the repo, every teammate's Claude Code session reads the same file, so everyone (and their AI) follows the same setup, conventions, and structure. That keeps development consistent, and a new teammate gets up to speed from one file instead of asking around.

1. In Claude Code, run:

   ```
   /init
   ```

2. Claude scans your project and writes `CLAUDE.md` to the repo root. Open it in Cursor and read it; it should describe your dashboard: how to run it (`streamlit run app.py`), the main files, and where the data lives. Fix anything that's off, or ask Claude to adjust it.

3. Commit it. In Claude Code:

   ```
   Commit CLAUDE.md with the message "Add project memory (CLAUDE.md)".
   ```

> **For your capstone:** run `/init` once you have a skeleton of the project, then keep `CLAUDE.md` updated as the project grows. Every new Claude Code session then starts already knowing your project.

**Checkpoint:** `CLAUDE.md` exists at the repo root, describes your dashboard, and is committed.

### 4.5 Merge to main

Your feature branch contains all the implementation work. Now you'll bring those changes into the `main` branch, making them the official version of the code.

> **Key Concept: Merging.**
>
> ```
> main:          A --- B --- C ─────────────── D (merge commit)
>                             \               /
> feature:                     E --- F --- G -
> ```
>
> Your feature branch diverged from `main` at point C. You then made commits E, F, and G on the feature branch. Merging creates a new commit (D) on `main` that incorporates all the changes from the feature branch. After the merge, `main` contains everything: the original code plus all your dashboard work.
>
> This is why feature branches are valuable; they let you develop freely without risking the stable `main` branch. When you're confident your work is complete, you merge once and know that `main` stays reliable.

1. **Confirm your branch and a clean slate.** In Claude Code:

   ```
   Which git branch am I on, and are there any uncommitted changes?
   ```

   You should be on your feature branch (e.g., `feature/sales-dashboard`) with nothing uncommitted. If Claude finds stray changes (a leftover `TASKS.md` edit is the usual suspect), have it commit them now, with their own message, rather than letting them tangle into the merge. Claude tends to run this same check on its own before merging; now you know why.

2. **Merge into main.** If Claude is still offering to merge from the end of your last milestone (the `finishing-a-development-branch` offer you held off on in Section 4.4), just accept it:

   ```
   Yes, merge to main now.
   ```

   Otherwise, ask directly. In Claude Code:

   ```
   Merge my current feature branch into main
   ```

   Either way, Claude switches to `main`, merges the feature branch, and reports the result.

3. **Push main to GitHub.** In Claude Code:

   ```
   Push main to GitHub
   ```

4. **Verify on GitHub:** Open your repository in a browser (`github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo]`). Just above the list of files, on the left, is a button showing the current branch name with a small branch icon next to it. Click that button and choose **main** from the dropdown (it may already be selected). Then confirm all the dashboard files are in the file list: `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, the `data` directory, and so on.

**Checkpoint:** The `main` branch on GitHub contains all your dashboard code.

## Section 5: Deploy (~15 min)

### Why deployment matters

> **Why This Matters:** Building something that only runs on your laptop doesn't deliver value. Deployment makes your work accessible to stakeholders: a manager, a client, or your capstone advisor can open a URL and see your dashboard without installing Python or cloning a repository. Going from analysis to a shared, accessible output is a skill most graduates lack. Many people can build charts in a Jupyter notebook; far fewer can deploy an interactive dashboard that stakeholders actually use.

Deployment is the final stage of the professional workflow. It transforms your local project into a publicly accessible application. It's also the handoff you reserved back in Section 2.2: the plan's final step, marked as yours, executed here by you.

```

### 5.1 Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

Streamlit Community Cloud is a free hosting service specifically designed for Streamlit applications. It reads your code directly from GitHub and runs it on their servers.

> **Prerequisite:** Your code must be merged to `main` (Section 4.5) before deploying. Streamlit Cloud deploys from the `main` branch by default.

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) in your browser.

2. Click **Continue to sign-in** on the landing page, then click **Continue with GitHub** and authorize Streamlit to access your repositories.

   > **First-time sign-in:** If this is your first time using Streamlit Cloud, the process involves a few extra steps after clicking "Continue with GitHub":
   > - You'll authorize Streamlit on GitHub (email-only permissions), then **verify your email** by entering a 6-digit code sent to your email address.
   > - After verification, you'll authorize Streamlit a second time with broader GitHub permissions (repository access, webhooks).
   > - Finally, you'll fill out a short account setup form: name, functional area (choose **Student**), development stage, and country. Click **Continue** to finish.
   >
   > On subsequent sign-ins, you'll skip straight to the dashboard.

3. Click **Create app** in the top-right corner, then select **Deploy a public app from GitHub** on the next page.

4. Configure the deployment:

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | **Repository** | `[your-username]/ai-dev-workflow-tutorial` |
   | **Branch** | `main` |
   | **Main file path** | `app.py` (or wherever your Streamlit entry point is) |
   | **App URL** (optional) | A custom slug like `sales-dashboard-yourname`; this determines the first part of your public URL |

5. Click **Deploy** and wait 1-2 minutes. Streamlit Cloud installs your dependencies (from `requirements.txt`), runs your app, and makes it available at a public URL.

6. When deployment completes, you receive a URL like:

   ```
   https://sales-dashboard-yourname.streamlit.app
   ```

   Open this URL and verify that your dashboard looks and functions the same as it did locally.

> **If deployment fails:** The most common cause is a missing or incorrect `requirements.txt`. Check that the file exists in your repository's `main` branch on GitHub and lists all required packages (streamlit, pandas, plotly, etc.). If it's missing, ask Claude to create one, commit, push, and redeploy.

### 5.2 Update your task board

Record the deployment on your board. Give Claude the live URL and let it finish the bookkeeping. In Claude Code:

```
The dashboard is live at [paste your URL]. Record the URL next to the
deployment milestone in TASKS.md (add the milestone if it's missing),
check off its criteria, and move it to Done. Then commit TASKS.md and
push main to GitHub.
```

You can also ask Claude to add the live URL to your README, which makes it easy to find when you submit.

You're on `main` now (the merge in Section 4.5 switched you there), so this last update commits straight to `main`. Pushing it makes your finished board visible on GitHub, which is what your instructor checks.

**Checkpoint:** The dashboard is live and accessible at a public URL. The deployment milestone is in the Done section of `TASKS.md` with the live URL recorded, and the update is pushed to GitHub.

## Section 6: Final verification checklist

Before submitting, walk through every item below. Each category corresponds to a section of this guide.

### Superpowers artifacts

- [ ] Design document created (`docs/superpowers/specs/<file>.md`)
- [ ] Implementation plan created (`docs/superpowers/plans/<file>.md`)

### Task board (TASKS.md)

- [ ] Milestones created from the PRD (4-8 of them: TASK-1, TASK-2, ...), each with acceptance criteria
- [ ] A Definition of Done applies to every milestone
- [ ] All implementation milestones are in the Done section, criteria checked

## Section 7: Submit your work

Every item above checked? Then you're done building; the last step is turning it in.

**Due: Wednesday, July 15, 2026 at 11:59 PM.** Submit the following to Brightspace under the **AI Dev Workflow Tutorial** assignment:

1. **GitHub repository link:** your public repo URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/ai-dev-workflow-tutorial`)

2. **Streamlit dashboard link:** your live deployed URL (e.g., `https://sales-dashboard-yourname.streamlit.app`)

3. **Your completed `TASKS.md`:** because the board lives in your repo. Just make sure the final `TASKS.md` on your `main` branch shows:
   - Every implementation milestone in the Done section, acceptance criteria checked
   - A commit hash recorded next to each done milestone
   - The Definition of Done checked off

   Your instructor can open `TASKS.md` on GitHub and run `git log -- TASKS.md` to see how the work progressed; that history is your evidence.

Make sure your `TASKS.md`, `prd/`, and `docs/superpowers/` files are included in your repository.

**Checkpoint:** Both links are submitted on Brightspace: your repo opens on GitHub, and your dashboard loads at its public URL.

> **After you submit: the walk-through.** Submitting the links isn't the last step; explaining the work is. In your second 1:1, you'll walk your instructor through what you built and how, live, with follow-up questions: why the work happened on a feature branch, what the design doc changed about what you built, what a commit message with a milestone ID makes possible, why the merge came before the deploy. This isn't a quiz to cram for, and it isn't a hunt for AI use (AI was expected everywhere in this tutorial). It checks the one thing a polished repo can't show: that the reasoning behind it is yours. Your prep material is already on the record. Reread your spec, your plan, your board, and your commit history, and make sure you can tell the story of each out loud with the tool closed. If you can, you're ready, both for this meeting and for the capstone, where you'll do the same thing in front of stakeholders.

## The complete workflow: what you accomplished

```
PRD [done] -> TASKS.md [done] -> brainstorming [done] -> writing-plans [done] -> Code [done] -> Commit [done] -> Push [done] -> Deploy [done] -> Live! [done]
```

In this guide, you practiced five professional skills:

1. **Skill-driven development:** You brainstormed, planned, broke down tasks, then implemented. This discipline works with any technical project, not just this tutorial.

2. **AI-assisted coding:** You used Claude Code as a tool guided by clear specifications. You saw how context engineering (the `@` symbol, CLAUDE.md, slash commands) makes AI assistance more precise.

3. **Task tracking in your repo:** Every piece of work was tracked from To Do to Done in `TASKS.md`, with each task linked to the commit that fulfilled it.

4. **Version control with Git and GitHub:** You created feature branches, committed with meaningful messages, pushed to a remote, and merged completed work.

5. **Deployment:** You turned a local script into a live application with a shareable URL.

> **For Your Career:** This workflow scales. Whether you're building a data pipeline, a dashboard, or a machine learning model, the pattern is the same: brainstorm, plan, track, build, deploy. You now have hands-on experience with the full cycle. In interviews, you can describe not just what you built but how you built it, and that process awareness matters to hiring managers.

## Troubleshooting

Something will break: a command won't run, the app won't start, a push gets rejected. That's normal, and you already have the best debugging tool installed: Claude Code.

**Ask Claude Code first.** It can see your project, read the error, run commands to investigate, and usually fix the problem for you. Give it the specifics:

- Paste the **exact** error message; don't paraphrase it.
- Say what you were trying to do and what you expected to happen.
- If the first fix doesn't work, paste the new error and let it try again.

For example:

```
I ran `streamlit run app.py` and got this error:
<paste the full error here>
What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

This handles the large majority of what goes wrong here: wrong file paths, a missing package, a port already in use, a rejected push, a merge conflict. Let Claude diagnose before you go hunting through documentation.

**Three habits that fix things before you even ask:**

- **Read the error.** It usually names the problem, and sometimes the fix.
- **Open a new terminal.** This alone clears most "command not found" errors right after you install a tool.
- **Check where you are.** Run `pwd`; Git and Streamlit commands only work inside your project folder.

**Still stuck?** Post in the Teams General channel, or send me a direct message on Teams, with what you were doing, the exact error, and what you already tried. Someone will help.

## Other Superpowers skills you'll meet later

You'll encounter these in larger projects beyond this tutorial. We didn't formally use them here either because they're more advanced than this project needs, or because we explicitly told the skill not to (in the brainstorm prompt).

| Skill | What it does | Why we skipped it here |
|-------|--------------|------------------------|
| `using-git-worktrees` | Creates an isolated working directory per branch so multiple branches can be checked out at the same time | We told brainstorming to skip it (in the prompt) to keep this project on a single working directory |
| `dispatching-parallel-agents` | Splits independent tasks across multiple agents that work in parallel | Overkill for a single-project tutorial |
| `subagent-driven-development` | Executes plans by dispatching a fresh subagent per task, with review checkpoints between | A more advanced execution model than executing-plans; same outcome, more moving parts |
| `writing-skills` | Helps you author your own Superpowers skills | Meta. For skill authors, not skill consumers |
| `systematic-debugging` | Walks through a structured debugging process when something breaks | Triggers automatically if your build hits an unexpected error |

## What's next

You now have a complete professional workflow you can apply to your capstone project and beyond. The same cycle (brainstorm, plan, track, build, deploy) works for any technical project, whether it's a data pipeline, a machine learning model, or another dashboard. The tools and habits transfer.

> **Can you explain it without Claude in the room?** Getting the dashboard to run is the easy half. The real test is whether you can walk someone through what you built and why, and defend the decisions, with the AI closed. That's what your capstone will ask of you: in advisor check-ins, stakeholder meetings, and presentations, you speak the reasoning, not just show the result. Practice it now: out loud, explain your spec, your plan, and one tradeoff you made. Any part that comes out fuzzy is the part to go back and understand, because the tools and the process here are yours to account for.

> **Bring your meetings into the loop.** In Part 1 you connected Claude Code to [Granola](https://www.granola.ai) (see [Section 2.6 of the setup guide](pre-work-setup.md#26-granola-app--connect-it-to-claude-code)). You didn't need it for the dashboard, but it's built for the capstone: record your stakeholder meetings in Granola, then start a Claude Code session and ask things like *"From this week's meeting notes, what did the client ask us to change?"* or *"Draft tasks in TASKS.md from the decisions in yesterday's kickoff."* The same plan-track-build workflow, now starting from what was actually said in the room.
